      "O Jesus, we adore you, who, in your love divine,\nConceal your mighty Godhead In forms of bread and wine.",
      "O Jesus, we adore you, Our victim and our priest,\nWhose precious blood and body Become our sacred feast.",
      "O Jesus, we adore you, Our Savior and our King,\nAnd with the saints and angels Our humble homage bring.",
      "O Jesus, we adore you; Come, live in us, we pray,\nThat all our thoughts and actions Be yours alone today.",
      "O come, all you who labor In sorrow and in pain;\nCome,eat this bread from heaven; Your peace and strength regain."
