    "refrain": "And he will raise you up on eagle's wings,\nbear you on the breath of dawn,\nmake you to shine like the sun,\nand hold you in the palm of his hand.",
    "verses": [
      "You who dwell in the shelter of the Lord\nwho abide in his shadow for life,\nsay to the Lord: \"My refuge, my rock in whom I trust!\"",
      "The snare of the fowler will never capture you,\nand famine will bring you no fear;\nunder his wings your refuge, his faithfulness your shield.",
      "You need not fear the terror of the night,\nnor the arrow that flies by day;\nthough thousands fall about you, near you it shall not come.",
      "For to his angels he's given a command\nto guard you in all of your ways;\nupon their hands they will bear you up,\nlest you dash your foot against a stone."
