      "O God, our help in ages past, Our hope for years to come,\nOur shelter from the stormy blast, And our eternal home.",
      "Beneath the shadow of your throne Your saints have dwelt secure,\nSufficient is your arm alone, And our defense is sure.",
      "Before the hills in order stood, Or earth received her frame,\nFrom everlasting you are God, To endless years the same.",
      "A thousand ages in your sight Are like an evening gone,\nShort as the watch that ends the night Before the rising sun.",
      "Time, like an ever-rolling stream, Bears all our lives away:\nThey fly, forgotten, as a dream Dies at the opening day",
      "O God, our help in ages past, Our hope for years to come,\nBe now our guide while life shall last, And our eternal home."
